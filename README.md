I more or less know English, but lately I need to translate much faster and Google Translator helps me at least sketch out an approximate text. The translation is clumsy, but at least it helps to make a sketch
This method helps to translate faster than copying and pasting the entire text into the translator. I also have a weak computer and translation plugins put a lot of strain on it, so this approach is the most optimal for me
